The back of this project runs primordially with Slim and Composer. It's all stored in the App folder.

It's critical to have Composer in the PC used for developing the code in order to keep libraries up to date
or install or manage any library.

The back is designed as an API. It doesn't manage templates nor any kind of view. It listens to requests, and returns a proper answer to whoever made the request.
The routes to the different pages of the front bounce back the request to the client, checking anything needed to be checked like if the user has properly logged
or the user rights via 'middlewares', which are layers of functions that are executed before the request can go any further.
If a middleware is passed, then the execution of the code assigned to the request can proceed. Otherwise, the client is redirected to some error page.
